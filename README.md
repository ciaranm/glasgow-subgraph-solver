The Glasgow Subgraph Solver
===========================

This is a solver for subgraph isomorphism (induced and non-induced) problems, based upon a series of
papers by subsets of Blair Archibald, Ciaran McCreesh, Patrick Prosser and James Trimble at the
University of Glasgow, and Fraser Dunlop and Ruth Hoffmann at the University of St Andrews. A clique
decision / maximum clique solver is also included.

If you use this software for research, please cite [icgt/McCreeshP020]. If you use this solver in a
non-research setting, please get in touch if you can. This software is an output of taxpayer funded
research, and it is very helpful for us if we can demonstrate real-world impact when we write grant
applications.

Please contact [Ciaran McCreesh](mailto:ciaran.mccreesh@glasgow.ac.uk) with any queries.

Compiling
---------

To build, type 'make'. You will need a C++17 compiler (we test with GCC 7.3, GCC 8.3, and Clang
7.0.1 on Linux, and Xcode 10.2 on Mac OS X) and Boost (we use 1.65.1 or later, built with the libraries: thread, system, program_options, and iostreams).

(KB: updating to C++20 requires GCC 10.1, Clang 10.0.0 or later; Xcode 10.2 appears to be fine but I
have not tested that)

Running
-------

To run:

```shell session
$ ./glasgow_subgraph_solver pattern-file target-file
```

If you would like induced subgraph isomorphisms rather than non-induced (that is, if non-adjacent
vertices must be mapped to non-adjacent vertices), you must request it:

```shell session
$ ./glasgow_subgraph_solver --induced pattern-file target-file
```

The default mode is to display the first found solution, or to prove unsatisfiability if no solution
exists. To count or print all solutions, use one of:

```shell session
$ ./glasgow_subgraph_solver [ --count-solutions | --print-all-solutions ] pattern-file target-file
```

Note that printing all solutions can be exponentially slower than counting solutions.

The solver supports parallel search. Usually you should enable this, as follows:

```shell session
$ ./glasgow_subgraph_solver --parallel ...
```

Note that parallel search, in its default configuration, is non-deterministic.

File Formats
------------

We try to auto-detect the input format, but it's best to specify it using, for example:

```shell session
$ ./glasgow_subgraph_solver --format lad pattern-file target-file
```

In particular, note that auto-detection can easily fail if, for example, the first vertex in the
graph has no neighbours.  We can read LAD, Labelled LAD (labels on vertices, and optionally also on
edges), CSV, and DIMACS 2 formatted graphs. [The LAD
format](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/christine.solnon/SIP.html) is a nice simple choice. If you need
to support named vertices, labels on vertices and / or edges, or directed edges, consider using the
CSV format. To specify a directed edge, use a greater-than sign rather than a comma as the delimiter
between the first two columns.  To specify an edge label, include a third column in the file. To
specify a vertex label, leave the second column empty and use the third column for the label. For
example, the following describes a graph with four vertices, with colours for edge labels and shapes
for vertex labels.

```
first>second,red
second>first,blue
first,third,purple
first>first,green
first,,circle
second,,circle
third,,square
fourth,,square
```

Symmetries
----------

Symmetry elimination support is currently very experimental, only usable on pattern symmetries, and
is probably only useful for solution counting. To use it, you must have the GAP computer algebra
system in your PATH as 'gap', with the 'digraph' library installed. Then, do:

```shell session
$ ./glasgow_clique_solver --pattern-symmetries --count-solutions pattern-file target-file
```

Proof Logging
-------------

As a highly experimental feature, the solver can output a proof log. First, install the following
program:

* VeriPB from https://github.com/StephanGocht/VeriPB/ .

And then you can produce and verify a log like this:

```shell session
$ ./glasgow_subgraph_solver --no-supplementals --no-clique-detection --no-nds \
    --prove myproof --proof-solutions pattern-file target-file
$ veripb myproof.opb myproof.log
```

Note that most features are not yet supported with proof logging. This is a "not yet implemented"
problem, not a fundamental restriction.

Clique Solving
--------------

To run the clique solver, use:

```shell session
$ ./glasgow_clique_solver graph-file
```

Details on the Algorithms
-------------------------

The subgraph solver is a constraint programming style backtracker, which recursively builds up a
mapping from pattern vertices to target vertices. It includes inference based upon paths (not just
adjacency) and neighbourhood degree sequences, has a fast all-different propagator, and uses
sophisticated variable- and value-ordering heuristics to direct a slightly-random restarting search.

Chronologically, our first subgraph isomorphism solver is [cp/McCreeshP15]. We introduced new
variants of this solver in [lion/KotthoffMS16], and described a refactored version (which can solve
an optimisation variant of the problem) in [aaai/HoffmannMR17]. We also investigated search ordering
heuristics in more detail in [jair/McCreeshPST18], and [cpaior/ArchibaldDHMPT19] describes its new
restarting search algorithm. There is currently no paper describing the entire algorithm, but
[icgt/McCreeshP020] summarises the main aspects of it.

The clique solver (with its default configuration) is a branch and bound solver that uses a greedy
colouring both as the bound function, and as a branching heuristic. It is based upon the "domains of
size two first" variant described in [cp/McCreeshP14], which is in turn derived from the "MCSa1"
algorithm described by [algorithms/Prosser12] combined with the bit-parallelism techniques discussed
by [ol/SegundoMRH13]; this in turn is a simplification of "MCS" described by [walcom/TomitaSHTW10].
The solver also incorporates the fast clique detection technique described by [jco/BatsynGMP14].
